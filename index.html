        <h2>Domain Summaries</h2>
      <h3>Domain 1</h3>
      <br />
    <p>Domain 1 covers essential HTML elements and their proper use in web development, focusing on script and noscript tags, link and meta tags, and overall HTML document structure. Script tags, usually containing JavaScript, are embedded within HTML to enable interactive features, while noscript tags provide fallback content for browsers without scripting support. Link tags connect HTML to external files like stylesheets, and meta tags provide metadata, including character encoding, keywords, viewport settings, and translation preferences. The domain also emphasizes the four main sections of an HTML document: DOCTYPE, HTML, head, and body, detailing their purposes and the importance of correct syntax. Practical steps guide learners in creating, editing, and previewing HTML documents, ensuring the inclusion of comments and entities for enhanced readability and functionality. By completing the projects, learners will master adding and configuring these tags and sections to build well-structured, functional webpages.</p>
    <br />
      <h3>Domain 2</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Domain 2 delves into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which are essential for controlling the formatting and layout of webpages. It covers the creation and application of different types of style sheets—external, internal, and inline—emphasizing the cascading nature of CSS, where inline styles override internal, and internal override external styles. Learners are guided through practical steps to create a style sheet, link it to HTML, and observe the results in a browser. The domain further explores CSS rule sets, detailing the correct syntax for selectors and property-value pairs, and demonstrates how to apply styles using classes and IDs, noting that classes can be reused multiple times while IDs are unique per page. Additionally, the domain introduces pseudo-classes, which apply specific styles to elements in particular states, such as when a user hovers over a link. By completing the outlined projects, learners will gain a solid understanding of how to create, manage, and apply CSS to achieve desired styling outcomes on their webpages.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Domain 3</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Domain 3 covers essential HTML elements and their practical applications in web development. It begins with creating and styling HTML tables, then progresses to using headings, paragraphs, and line breaks for text formatting. It introduces the Hr, Div, and Span tags for content organization and separation, followed by unordered and ordered lists for structured data. The domain also covers semantic tags for better HTML document organization, interactive details and summary tags, and the use of figure and caption tags for images. Additionally, it teaches how to link images, create hyperlinks, and bookmarks, and distinguish between relative and absolute links. It also addresses navigating folder hierarchies, using map and area tags for image maps, and enhancing accessibility with input forms. The domain concludes with input types, labels, the select tag for dropdowns, the textarea tag for multiline input, button tags for form actions, and output tags for real-time calculations in forms.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Domain 4</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Domain 4 focuses on incorporating multimedia elements and advanced HTML techniques into web pages. It begins with adding and resizing images to fit web layouts while maintaining quality, and it includes exercises for linking images and using tables for image alignment. The domain then covers embedding videos with multiple formats and controls for playback, followed by adding audio files with controls and integrating subtitles using track tags. Lastly, it introduces iframes for embedding external content within a webpage. By completing these projects, learners gain practical skills in enhancing web pages with images, videos, audio, and embedded content, ensuring compatibility and user control.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Domain 5</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Domain 5 covers various CSS positioning and styling techniques essential for creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages. It starts with setting the height and max-width properties to control the layout, ensuring elements fit within average screen sizes. Float positioning allows elements to move aside, enabling others to fill the space. Relative and absolute positioning offer precise control over element placement, with absolute positioning affecting the page flow. Static and fixed positioning further refine element placement, with fixed elements anchored to the browser window. Overflow and alignment settings manage text overflow and alignment, while the display property differentiates between block and inline elements. Visibility settings control element display dynamically. The box model, including margins and padding, defines element spacing, while font properties such as families, colors, styles, weights, and variants enhance text presentation. Link colors and text decoration improve navigation aesthetics. Indentation, line-height, and word-wrap properties enhance text readability. Letter and word spacing, border properties, and background settings contribute to overall design. Divs and color usage, along with units of measure, ensure consistent styling. Viewport and media queries facilitate responsive design, adapting to various device screens. Finally, the use of percentages and pixels in layout design balances fluidity and control across different screen sizes.</p>
      <br />
      <h3>Domain 6</h3>
      <br />
      <p>Domain 6 covers various aspects of CSS and HTML best practices and error management. It begins with the importance of reusing CSS rule sets to save time and reduce errors, explaining how to copy and paste code appropriately. The use of CSS comments is emphasized for collaboration and testing, showing how to add and comment out code. Cross-browser testing and the use of Web Safe fonts ensure that webpages display correctly across different browsers. Separating HTML structure from CSS styling makes code easier to manage. Accessibility is highlighted with guidelines on using text alternatives, ensuring proper color contrast, and setting a logical tab order. Proper text hierarchy using heading tags improves webpage organization and accessibility. Identifying and fixing syntax errors is crucial for CSS functionality, as browsers can be forgiving with HTML errors but not with CSS. Developers must also manage tag mismatches and understand cascading issues in CSS, using tools like Developer Tools and understanding specificity and the `!important` keyword to resolve conflicts. Overall, Domain 6 provides a comprehensive guide to creating efficient, accessible, and error-free web pages.</p>
